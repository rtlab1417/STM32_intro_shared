# Title: Getting Start with STM32 using STM32CubeIDE and HAL

## Objectives
1. To learn the MCU and its registers
2. To deploy official ST IDE - namely STM32CubeIDE
3. To deploy official ST Hardware Abstract Layer (HAL)

The learners are encouraged to read the datasheets / manual and experiment the practices.
The learning path and knowledge are applicable to other STM32 MCU.  
Refer to the module attached. 

## Market Parts
The learners are urged to buy the market parts online. They are pretty cheap and easily available.

1. BluePill - STM32F103C8T6 x 1
2. ST-Link V2 - clone x 1
3. USB to UART Converter x 1
4. RGB breakout board x 1
5. Push button x 2
6. Resistor 1/4 W, 200 ~ 500 Ohm x 3
7. Resistor 1/4 W, 1k - 4.7k Ohm x 2
8. Breadboard x 1
9. Jumper wire
10. OLED 0.96", 128 x 64, I2C x 1

Will add on as the practices expanding.
