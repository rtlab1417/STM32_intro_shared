# STM32_intro_shared
## Getting Start with STM32 using STM32CubeIDE and HAL

# STM32F103C8T6 
also known as Blue Pill

# Objectives
1. To learn the MCU and the registers
2. To deploy official ST IDE - namely STM32CubeIDE
3. To deploy official ST Hardware Abstract Layer (HAL)

Minimum cost.
The learning path and knowledge are applicable to other STM32 MCU.
